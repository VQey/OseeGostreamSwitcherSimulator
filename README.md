# OseeGostreamSwitcherSimulator
Osee Go Stream Switcher Simulator application - act like the real switcher - for Tally System development

Osee GoStream Simulator. 
I used to test my Tally System but sometimes I need to test it multiple System at the same time. This software will act as Osee Switcher but only limited to Program, Preview, Cut, Auto only. Run smoothly with Osee Go Stream Desktop Windows/Mac App, Smart Tally App. Available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

Use same port as ogsd at : 19010

You can use as Switcher experience before you buy the real switcher. but REMEMBER! This app are not presenting as the Real Switcher works, its all way better the Switcher than this simulator. Suit for anybody want to build and test or sell Osee tally system.
